Using data sheets

This lesson we were using the data we made last lesson to make a much more complex system of making code that people had to work out.Instead of just having one way of coding it we now had 26 by using all the letters of the alphabet into a data sheet and we could change the letter that a certain letter would change to by just changing one solitary number.This worked ok for me but I would like to try and progress it on for homework to make it as good as possible.
