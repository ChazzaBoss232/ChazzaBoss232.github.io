**Introduction to Spreadsheets**

This lesson we started by listening to an explanation to help us understand the new project that we would be doing.He started by giving us a word to decode and we had to try and make it into a normal word.He demonstrated to us how to do this before next showing it to us on the computer.

Next, we moved onto the spreadsheet where he showed us the same pattern again and how he got there using the code.It was actually pretty simple and interesting once we got the hang of it.

Next we had a go at this by ourselves using a colour coordination and the code.Next time I am going to try and listen a bit harder.
