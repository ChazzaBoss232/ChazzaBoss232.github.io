Data Spreadsheets

This lesson we continued to look at Spreadsheets, but this lesson we expanded further into this by looking at a more complex data system which instead of using two rows of the alphabet, used 26 rows instead giving you much more potential for options.I managed to successfully get this data sheet up but then next we had to get this sheet to make a working code encryptor which we also had the power to change.I struggled to do this part and therefore had to get help which I would like to try and improve on on both working better and trying to learn more.
