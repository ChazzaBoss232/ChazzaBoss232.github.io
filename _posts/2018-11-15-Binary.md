Binary

Today we were discussing a new part to our It coding and this was binary.Mr Tansley was telling us about how binary was around when he was a kid and how it is used in multiple programs and especially its use in colour.After this we had to copy and paste this binary code from a website onto our new spreadsheet ahead of next week.Next time I will try to make notes on what we were listening to, to make sure I know it all.
