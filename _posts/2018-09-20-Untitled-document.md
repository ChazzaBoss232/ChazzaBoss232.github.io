Further Spreadsheets

This lesson we continued working on google sheets and we were focusing on further advancing our secret code for the word 'hello world'.Last lesson we had to encode it and this lesson we had to decode it.

Firstly we listened to a demonstration to see the ways to turn it back into a normal word.Mr Keen explained lots of multiple different ways but the main way was to use the code 'concatenate'.Once we had finished the demonstration we went book to our own computers and I successfully managed to get it back to ‘Hello World’.

Next lesson I would like to listen a bit harder and try not to rely on the help of my peers as much.
